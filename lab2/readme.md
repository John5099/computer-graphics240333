  BRESENHAM’S LINE DRAWING ALGORITHM
  1. Input the two line end-points, storing the left end-point in (x0, y0)
  2. Plot the point (x0, y0)
  3. Calculate the constants Δx, Δy, 2Δy, and (2Δy - 2Δx) and get the first value for the decision
    parameter as:
      P<sub>0</sub>= 2 Δy -  Δx
  4. At each xk along the line, starting at k = 0, perform the following test. If pk < 0, the next point
    to plot is (xk+1, yk ) and:
      p<sub>k+1</sub> =p<sub>k + 2 Δy
   Otherwise, the next point to plot is (xk+1, yk+1) and:
      p<sub>k+1 = p<sub>k</sub>+2Δy-2Δx
  5. Repeat step 4 (Δx – 1) times
